Description: Explore and download data from the recount project available at
    https://lcolladotor.shinyapps.io/recount/. Using the recount package you can
    download RangedSummarizedExperiment objects at the gene or exon level,
    the raw counts, the phenotype metadata used, the urls to the sample coverage
    bigWig files or the mean coverage bigWig file for a particular study. The
    RangedSummarizedExperiment objects can be used by different packages for
    performing differential expression analysis. Using
    http://bioconductor.org/packages/derfinder you can perform
    annotation-agnostic differential expression analyses with the data from the
    recount project.
